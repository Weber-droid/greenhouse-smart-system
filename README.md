The greenhouse system project is aimed at creating a smart environment for optimal plant growth using an embedded system.
The system utilizes sensors such as a moisture sensor and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to monitor environmental conditions inside the greenhouse.
The moisture sensor helps in monitoring soil moisture levels, ensuring that plants receive adequate water.
The DHT11 sensor provides real-time data on temperature and humidity, allowing users to maintain optimal growing conditions for plants.
The embedded system communicates this sensor data to a web application via MQTT, which is hosted on a Flask server.
The web application displays the sensor data in real-time, allowing users to monitor and control the greenhouse environment remotely.
Additionally, the system includes features such as light control, fan control, and pump control,
which can be operated through the web interface to further customize the greenhouse environment for plant growth.
